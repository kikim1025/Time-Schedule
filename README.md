# Time-Schedule
React Redux Full Stack Application for users to sign up on time slots.
Deployed Version: https://blooming-thicket-31223.herokuapp.com/

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack single-page application that uses Node.js and Express to deploy a server on backend. This project uses React.js with Redux for frontend, with some reactstrap for modal. The communication between client and server is done through Axios.

## Project Usage
The project website will show login page first. A new user can enter name, after which schedule component will be loaded to UI. The schedule shows 1-hour time slots for 9am to 5pm, from Monday to Friday. By clicking on a time slot, the user can reserve the time slot. All slots already occupied by other users will show up red, while the user's own will show up green.
